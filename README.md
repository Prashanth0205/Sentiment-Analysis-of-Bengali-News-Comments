## Sentiment Analysis of Bengali News Comments

In this project, Bengali news comments are analyzed to extract sentiment information, providing deeper insights into public sentiment and opinion on various news topics. Sentiment analysis helps in understanding the prevailing attitudes, emotions, and opinions expressed by Bengali news readers in response to different news articles.

By employing machine learning models like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree, the project explores the effectiveness of these techniques in accurately classifying sentiments expressed in Bengali text. Each model is trained on a labeled dataset of Bengali news comments, where sentiments are categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.

The project delves into the preprocessing steps required for handling Bengali text data, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words. Feature extraction techniques are applied to represent the textual data in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized to assess the performance of each model in classifying sentiments accurately. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation are employed to ensure robustness and reliability of the results.
